# Git setup

# Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration
# variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables
# can be stored in three different places:
# - [path]/etc/gitconfig file: Contains values applied to every user on the system
#   and all their repositories. If you pass the option --system to git config, it
#   reads and writes from this file specifically. Because this is a system
#   configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to
#   make changes to it.
# - ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config file: Values specific personally to you,
#   the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing
#   the --global option, and this affects all of the repositories you work with on
#   your system.
# - config file in the Git directory (that is, .git/config) of whatever repository
#   youâ€™re currently using: Specific to that single repository. You can force Git
#   to read from and write to this file with the --local option, but that is in
#   fact the default. Unsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git
#   repository for this option to work properly.

# You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using:

git config --list --show-origin
