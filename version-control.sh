# About Version Control System

# A Version Control System (VCS) is a system that records changes to a file or set
# of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. VCS allows
# you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project
# back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified
# something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and
# more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files,
# you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.
